## How to use it

```
yarn start
```

Don't forget to launch your browser with disabled CORS and write the full domain for your cozy when reaching http://localhost:1234/index.html :

```
http://cozy.tools:8080
```


For the tests, you may fill a /local.config.js inside playgrounds with `{ "keysInstance": "your email on the bitwarden official server"}` until there is a cozy server compatible with bitwarden.
